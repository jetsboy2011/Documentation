&lt;p>ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern cloud-optimized web applications. ASP.NET Core apps are lightweight and modular, with built-in support for dependency injection, enabling greater testability and maintainability. Combined with MVC, which supports building modern web APIs in addition to view-based apps, ASP.NET Core is a powerful framework with which to build enterprise web applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mvc-and-razor-pages">MVC and Razor Pages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ASP.NET Core MVC offers many features that are useful for building web-based APIs and apps. The term MVC stands for &amp;ldquo;Model-View-Controller&amp;rdquo;, a UI pattern that breaks up the responsibilities of responding to user requests into several parts. In addition to following this pattern, you can also implement features in your ASP.NET Core apps as Razor Pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Razor Pages are built into ASP.NET Core MVC, and use the same features for routing, model binding, filters, authorization, etc. However, instead of having separate folders and files for Controllers, Models, Views, etc. and using attribute-based routing, Razor Pages are placed in a single folder (&amp;quot;/Pages&amp;quot;), route based on their relative location in this folder, and handle requests with handlers instead of controller actions. As a result, when working with Razor Pages, all of the files and classes you need are typically colocated, not spread throughout the web project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you create a new ASP.NET Core App, you should have a plan in mind for the kind of app you want to build. When creating a new project, in your IDE or using the &lt;code>dotnet new&lt;/code> CLI command, you will choose from several templates. The most common project templates are Empty, Web API, Web App, and Web App (Model-View-Controller). Although you can only make this decision when you first create a project, it&amp;rsquo;s not an irrevocable decision. The Web API project uses standard Model-View-Controller controllers – it just lacks Views by default. Likewise, the default Web App template uses Razor Pages, and so also lacks a Views folder. You can add a Views folder to these projects later to support view-based behavior. Web API and Model-View-Controller projects don&amp;rsquo;t include a Pages folder by default, but you can add one later to support Razor Pages-based behavior. You can think of these three templates as supporting three different kinds of default user interaction: data (web API), page-based, and view-based. However, you can mix and match any or all of these templates within a single project if you wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-razor-pages">Why Razor Pages?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Razor Pages is the default approach for new web applications in Visual Studio. Razor Pages offers a simpler way of building page-based application features, such as non-SPA forms. Using controllers and views, it was common for applications to have very large controllers that worked with many different dependencies and view models and returned many different views. This resulted in more complexity and often resulted in controllers that didn&amp;rsquo;t follow the Single Responsibility Principle or Open/Closed Principles effectively. Razor Pages addresses this issue by encapsulating the server-side logic for a given logical &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo; in a web application with its Razor markup. A Razor Page that has no server-side logic can only consist of a Razor file (for instance, &amp;ldquo;Index.cshtml&amp;rdquo;). However, most non-trivial Razor Pages will have an associated page model class, which by convention is named the same as the Razor file with a &amp;ldquo;.cs&amp;rdquo; extension (for example, &amp;ldquo;Index.cshtml.cs&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Razor Page&amp;rsquo;s page model combines the responsibilities of an MVC controller and a viewmodel. Instead of handling requests with controller action methods, page model handlers like &amp;ldquo;OnGet()&amp;rdquo; are executed, rendering their associated page by default. Razor Pages simplifies the process of building individual pages in an ASP.NET Core app, while still providing all the architectural features of ASP.NET Core MVC. They&amp;rsquo;re a good default choice for new page-based functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="when-to-use-mvc">When to use MVC&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re building web APIs, the MVC pattern makes more sense than trying to use Razor Pages. If your project will only expose web API endpoints, you should ideally start from the Web API project template. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add controllers and associated API endpoints to any ASP.NET Core app. Use the view-based MVC approach if you&amp;rsquo;re migrating an existing application from ASP.NET MVC 5 or earlier to ASP.NET Core MVC and you want to do so with the least amount of effort. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve made the initial migration, you can evaluate whether it makes sense to adopt Razor Pages for new features or even as a wholesale migration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether you choose to build your web app using Razor Pages or MVC views, your app will have similar performance and will include support for dependency injection, filters, model binding, validation, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="working-with-dependencies">Working with dependencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ASP.NET Core has built-in support for and internally makes use of a technique known as &lt;a href="../../aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection">dependency injection&lt;/a>. Dependency injection is a technique that enables loose coupling between different parts of an application. Looser coupling is desirable because it makes it easier to isolate parts of the application, allowing for testing or replacement. It also makes it less likely that a change in one part of the application will have an unexpected impact somewhere else in the application. Dependency injection is based on the dependency inversion principle, and is often key to achieving the open/closed principle. When evaluating how your application works with its dependencies, beware of the &lt;a href="https://deviq.com/static-cling/">static cling&lt;/a> code smell, and remember the aphorism &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://ardalis.com/new-is-glue">new is glue&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Static cling occurs when your classes make calls to static methods, or access static properties, which have side effects or dependencies on infrastructure. For example, if you have a method that calls a static method, which in turn writes to a database, your method is tightly coupled to the database. Anything that breaks that database call will break your method. Testing such methods is notoriously difficult, since such tests either require commercial mocking libraries to mock the static calls, or can only be tested with a test database in place. Static calls that don&amp;rsquo;t have any dependence on infrastructure, especially those calls that are completely stateless, are fine to call and have no impact on coupling or testability (beyond coupling code to the static call itself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many developers understand the risks of static cling and global state, but will still tightly couple their code to specific implementations through direct instantiation. &amp;ldquo;New is glue&amp;rdquo; is meant to be a reminder of this coupling, and not a general condemnation of the use of the &lt;code>new&lt;/code> keyword. Just as with static method calls, new instances of types that have no external dependencies typically do not tightly couple code to implementation details or make testing more difficult. But each time a class is instantiated, take just a brief moment to consider whether it makes sense to hard-code that specific instance in that particular location, or if it would be a better design to request that instance as a dependency.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="declare-your-dependencies">Declare your dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>ASP.NET Core is built around having methods and classes declare their dependencies, requesting them as arguments. ASP.NET applications are typically set up in &lt;em>Program.cs&lt;/em> or in a &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class.&lt;/p>

Configuring apps completely in &lt;em>Program.cs&lt;/em> is the default approach for .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022 apps. Project templates have been updated to help you get started with this new approach. ASP.NET Core projects can still use a &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class, if desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="configure-services-in-_programcs_">Configure services in &lt;em>Program.cs&lt;/em>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For very simple apps, you can wire up dependencies directly in &lt;em>Program.cs&lt;/em> file using a &lt;code>WebApplicationBuilder&lt;/code>. Once all needed services have been added, the builder is used to create the app.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>Startup.cs&lt;/em> is itself configured to support dependency injection at several points. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class, you can give it a constructor and it can request dependencies through it, like so:&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class is interesting in that there are no explicit type requirements for it. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t inherit from a special &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> base class, nor does it implement any particular interface. You can give it a constructor, or not, and you can specify as many parameters on the constructor as you want. When the web host you&amp;rsquo;ve configured for your application starts, it will call the &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class (if you&amp;rsquo;ve told it to use one), and will use dependency injection to populate any dependencies the &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class requires. Of course, if you request parameters that aren&amp;rsquo;t configured in the services container used by ASP.NET Core, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an exception, but as long as you stick to dependencies the container knows about, you can request anything you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dependency injection is built into your ASP.NET Core apps right from the start, when you create the Startup instance. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there for the Startup class. You can also request dependencies in the &lt;code>Configure&lt;/code> method:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="color:#204a87;font-weight:bold">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#204a87;font-weight:bold">void&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000">Configure&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">IApplicationBuilder&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000">app&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000">IHostingEnvironment&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000">env&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000">ILoggerFactory&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000">loggerFactory&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The ConfigureServices method is the exception to this behavior; it must take just one parameter of type &lt;code>IServiceCollection&lt;/code>. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to support dependency injection, since on the one hand it is responsible for adding objects to the services container, and on the other it has access to all currently configured services via the IServiceCollection parameter. Thus, you can work with dependencies defined in the ASP.NET Core services collection in every part of the &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class, either by requesting the needed service as a parameter or by working with the &lt;code>IServiceCollection&lt;/code> in &lt;code>ConfigureServices&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>

&lt;/div>
If you need to ensure certain services are available to your &lt;code>Startup&lt;/code> class, you can configure them using an &lt;code>IWebHostBuilder&lt;/code> and its &lt;code>ConfigureServices&lt;/code> method inside the &lt;code>CreateDefaultBuilder&lt;/code> call.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Startup class is a model for how you should structure other parts of your ASP.NET Core application, from Controllers to Middleware to Filters to your own Services. In each case, you should follow the &lt;a href="https://deviq.com/explicit-dependencies-principle/">Explicit Dependencies Principle&lt;/a>, requesting your dependencies rather than directly creating them, and leveraging dependency injection throughout your application. Be careful of where and how you directly instantiate implementations, especially services and objects that work with infrastructure or have side effects. Prefer working with abstractions defined in your application core and passed in as arguments to hardcoding references to specific implementation types.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="structuring-the-application">Structuring the application&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Monolithic applications typically have a single entry point. In the case of an ASP.NET Core web application, the entry point will be the ASP.NET Core web project. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the solution should consist of just a single project. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to break up the application into different layers in order to follow separation of concerns. Once broken up into layers, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to go beyond folders to separate projects, which can help achieve better encapsulation. The best approach to achieve these goals with an ASP.NET Core application is a variation of the Clean Architecture discussed in chapter 5. Following this approach, the application&amp;rsquo;s solution will comprise separate libraries for the UI, Infrastructure, and ApplicationCore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these projects, separate test projects are included as well (Testing is discussed in Chapter 9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application&amp;rsquo;s object model and interfaces should be placed in the ApplicationCore project. This project will have as few dependencies as possible (and none on specific infrastructure concerns), and the other projects in the solution will reference it. Business entities that need to be persisted are defined in the ApplicationCore project, as are services that do not directly depend on infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementation details, such as how persistence is performed or how notifications might be sent to a user, are kept in the Infrastructure project. This project will reference implementation-specific packages such as Entity Framework Core, but should not expose details about these implementations outside of the project. Infrastructure services and repositories should implement interfaces that are defined in the ApplicationCore project, and its persistence implementations are responsible for retrieving and storing entities defined in ApplicationCore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ASP.NET Core UI project is responsible for any UI level concerns, but should not include business logic or infrastructure details. In fact, ideally it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have a dependency on the Infrastructure project, which will help ensure no dependency between the two projects is introduced accidentally. This can be achieved using a third-party DI container like Autofac, which allows you to define DI rules in Module classes in each project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another approach to decoupling the application from implementation details is to have the application call microservices, perhaps deployed in individual Docker containers. This provides even greater separation of concerns and decoupling than leveraging DI between two projects, but has additional complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="feature-organization">Feature organization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>By default, ASP.NET Core applications organize their folder structure to include Controllers and Views, and frequently ViewModels. Client-side code to support these server-side structures is typically stored separately in the wwwroot folder. However, large applications may encounter problems with this organization, since working on any given feature often requires jumping between these folders. This gets more and more difficult as the number of files and subfolders in each folder grows, resulting in a great deal of scrolling through Solution Explorer. One solution to this problem is to organize application code by &lt;em>feature&lt;/em> instead of by file type. This organizational style is typically referred to as feature folders or &lt;a href="../../archive/msdn-magazine/2016/september/asp-net-core-feature-slices-for-asp-net-core-mvc">feature slices&lt;/a> (see also: &lt;a href="https://deviq.com/vertical-slices/">Vertical Slices&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ASP.NET Core MVC supports Areas for this purpose. Using areas, you can create separate sets of Controllers and Views folders (as well as any associated models) in each Area folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When using Areas, you must use attributes to decorate your controllers with the name of the area to which they belong:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-layered-architecture">What is a layered architecture?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As your projects become larger it becomes helpful to break the project into parts based on responsibilities or concerns. This idea of separating pieces of your project from one another makes it ultimately easier to test your software and ensure that it is working as you would expect. Just like you wouldn’t want to write overly lengthy methods for that very same reason, we want to avoid single projects that take on too much responsibility for the workload of the application. This separation involves splitting the codebase into multiple projects which we will refer to as &lt;em>layers&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of advantages to using layers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easier to work with in teams as individuals can focus on distinct layers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simplifies the process of understanding a codebase as each layer is isolated from each other and classes are typically grouped together by responsibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Testing is easier&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are also disadvantages, but for now we will focus on the rationale behind this framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tiered-architecture">Tiered Architecture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you do enough searching you’ll quickly come across a number of ideas on how large software projects should be organized. Some of the most common approaches to software architecture for ASP.NET projects include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tiered Architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Onion Architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hexagonal Architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean Architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vertical Slice Architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>RoverCore is organized as an Tiered Architecture but in many of the above architectures there is a clear separation of what each layer is responsible for. The project itself is organized into three layers with distinct responsibilities and is intended to help you begin the process of understanding how to work with multi-project web applications. As you grow in your understanding of ASP.NET you may decide to add additional layers as your project grows in scope. You may also make stricter decisions on how to isolate the responsibilities of each layer. For example, you may decide to avoid making any direct calls to Entity Framework code in the Infrastructure layer from the Web layer in the chance that you want to swap out EF for something else. For now, these layers can make it easier to reuse your code, as one layer may share much of the code you might reuse in an entirely different project.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="../../docs/concepts/layeredarchitecture.svg" width="600"/>
&lt;p>The organization for RoverCore consists of three tiers (or layers):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Presentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As you see with the above diagram, the arrows always point inward towards the core. This is because each layer depends on an inner layer to function. The Core layer is intended to be as free of dependencies as possible as it is typical that all projects will depend on the Core layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="presentation-layer">Presentation Layer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The presentation layer is closest to the end user, and contains the actual user interface they have to interact with your application. Whether the interface is html-based, an API, or even a mobile app, there are a myriad of ways that your data can be presented to the user. Ideally you would not place a lot of the business logic (decisions about what happens to data when it is stored or outputted) in this layer, but as a beginner it may be easier for you to begin your journey placing these coding decisions in your controllers. As you progress you may decide to push business logic to another layer entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="infrastructure-layer">Infrastructure Layer&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="core-layer">Core Layer&lt;/h3>
