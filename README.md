## About this Documentation

RoverCore documentation is built using Docsy.  Docsy is a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites, providing easy
site navigation, structure, and more. 

In this project, the Docsy theme is included as a Git submodule:

```bash
$ git submodule
...<hash>... themes/docsy (remotes/origin/HEAD)
```

You can find detailed theme instructions in the [Docsy user guide][].

This Docsy Example Project is hosted on [Netlify][] at [example.docsy.dev][].
You can view deploy logs from the [deploy section of the project's Netlify
dashboard][deploys], or this [alternate dashboard][].


## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
